## Lesson Learnt:
The main lesson learned in our project is:

First, have a good time management and teamwork. Our group formed a schedule after the lecturer gave the task. It is to make sure that our project can be completed within the time given. Besides that, all team member follows the schedule well and did their part as stated in the schedule.
Second, having a proper communication between members. Our group had discussion through Microsoft Teams and everyone explain their part so that the code can be compiled without hassle then all members are aware with the current project progress.
